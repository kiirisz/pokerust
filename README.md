# POKÉRUST

## Summary

This is just a little thing i'm doing, using Rust and the very brilliant PokéAPI. It's meant to, eventually, become a fully fledged text-based pokémon battle simulator.


## Status

As of yet it's just a tiny thing that gets data from said API and sort of handles it poorly, but I hope it'll eventually get to be something.
